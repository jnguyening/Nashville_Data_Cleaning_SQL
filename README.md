# Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project


## Overview

This project utilizes MS SQL Server to transform a fragmented real estate dataset into a standardized, query-ready resource. The technical solution involves complex Self-Joins to populate missing geographic data, PARSENAME string manipulation to split address fields, and CTEs to remove redundant records. This project highlights the critical "pre-processing" phase of data analysis, ensuring that downstream reporting is built on a foundation of accurate and clean data.
